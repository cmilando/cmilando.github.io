Welcome! I'm Chad, a research scientist studying the health impacts of climate change at Boston University, as part of the [Center for Climate and Health](https://sites.bu.edu/climateandhealth/).

My primary research focus is using novel data science methods to study the impact of climate change on human health. I have ongoing research projects related to the health impacts of heat and heatwaves, flooding, power outages, wildfire smoke, and others. You can see my recent publications [here](https://chadmilando.com/publications/).

I also create software and code for both [teaching](https://chadmilando.com/teaching/) and [applied](https://chadmilando.com/tools/) purposes. These range from the arcane (spreadsheets) to more modern methods (R shiny applications).

Finally, I invest in the people I work with, as a mentor and community member. You can see some of my mentorship philosophy [here](https://chadmilando.com/mentorship/).
