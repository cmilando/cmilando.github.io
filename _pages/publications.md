Wellenius. __"Generalizability of heat-related health risk associations observed in a large healthcare claims database of patients with commercial health insurance."__ Epidemiology (2024): 10-1097. [Link](https://journals.lww.com/epidem/abstract/9900/generalizability_of_heat_related_health_risk.285.aspx)

- We showed that changes in incidence rates of ED visits related to heat illness were similar in a general population dataset and a commercially insured dataset, giving up confidence that the commercial data can continued to be used to investigate health impacts in this type of study.

- In a small pilot study of portable air cleaner (PAC) usage in low-income homes, we found that hourly average PM concentrations decreased when PACs were turned on (vs. when they were turned off) across households during the study period: PM1 decreased by 0.46 µg/m3, PM2.5 decreased by 0.69 µg/m3, and PM10 decreased by 3.22 µg/m3. Our findings highlight some difficulties in implementing household PAC interventions, yet also provide evidence to support household-level interventions to reduce PM and other indoor sources of air pollution. We also highlight academic-community partnerships as contributing to evidence-based solutions.

[Link](https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jama/article-abstract/2799661)

- We quantified the health impact of the 2021 Pacific Northwest Heatwave among people with commercial health insurance. In Seattle, the rate of ED visits related to heat exposure more than doubled during the heatwave.

- We assessed heat exposure in Chelsea MA using a range of traditional to novel methods. We saw significant differences across temperature metrics: median personal temperature exposures were 3.9 °C higher than median ambient weather station temperatures. Existing air conditioning (AC) units did not adequately control indoor temperatures to desired thermostat levels: even with AC use, indoor maximum temperatures increased by 0.24 °C per °C of maximum outdoor temperature.
