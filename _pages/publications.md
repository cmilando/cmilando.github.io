- We quantified the health impact of the 2021 Pacific Northwest Heatwave among people with commercial health insurance. In Seattle, the rate of ED visits related to heat exposure more than doubled during the heatwave.

- We assessed heat exposure in Chelsea MA using a range of traditional to novel methods. We saw significant differences across temperature metrics: median personal temperature exposures were 3.9 °C higher than median ambient weather station temperatures. Existing air conditioning (AC) units did not adequately control indoor temperatures to desired thermostat levels: even with AC use, indoor maximum temperatures increased by 0.24 °C per °C of maximum outdoor temperature.
