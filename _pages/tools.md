## Macro for Compilation of Report-backs (MCR)

[This repository](https://github.com/cmilando/reportback-vba) contains the code for the Macro for Compilation of Report-backs (MCR), an open-source, generalizable tool designed to provide researchers in health studies with a flexible and scalable method for compiling individual reports. If you use MCR in your projects, please cite [Polka et. al., 2021](https://doi.org/10.3390/ijerph18116104). Let me know if you have any questions!

## Framework for Rapid Exposure and Health Effects Estimation (FRESH-Est)

The Framework for Rapid Exposure and Health Effects Estimation (FRESH-Est) is a tool that allows users to estimate the health affects attributable to point source emissions. The tool combines dispersion modeling (AERMOD) with calculations of attributable burden (similar to the EPAâ€™s BenMAP program) in a single framework. The benefits of using FRESH-Est are: 1) health effects for various emissions scenarios can be estimated quickly, and 2) there is an optimization module that focuses on receptor concentrations, health effects, or inequality impacts. See the [Milando, Martenies, and Batterman, 2016](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.envint.2016.06.005) for more details. A working demo is also available in [this google folder](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/10FAlCxDc57wwkE5jNLcrf3qc4bGVUkso?usp=sharing) (access available upon request).
