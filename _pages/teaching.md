## B-spline functions

B-splines are an essential part of many computer science functions, but what are they and how do they work? I developed [a spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1E8ozpvn5O1euQtNcaiMLqa-QP4Q_PBpoAX7TgeKYCkU/edit?usp=sharing) to walk through the Cox-de Boor recursion implementation of cubic b-splines with one knot.

## Conditional and Unconditional Poisson regression

Recreating the similarity between the conditional and unconditional poisson models for case-crossover epidemiology. In a [google sheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1eNbHk5S-NEwsu49rO7XXXCVJnmLdLUQRxH3OQ-5HwUU/edit?usp=sharing), Solver used to minimize the log-likelihood function. Sample R code and data adapted from: ["Conditional Poisson models: a flexible alternative to conditional logistic case cross-over analysis" by Ben Armstrong, Antonio Gasparrini, Aurelio Tobias. BMC Medical Research Methodology - 2014](https://bmcmedresmethodol.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/1471-2288-14-122).

## Distributed Lag Non-linear Modeling (DLNM)

A fully worked [google sheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1SP6PTXO6TtaVxoACTi5at0KpCNa9jmGhb6vR4PSiYmg/edit?usp=sharing]) of the steps of Distributed Lag Non-linear Modeling, as described by Dr. Antonio Gasparrini in
["Modeling exposure–lag–response associations with distributed lag non-linear models" by Antonio Gasparrini. Statistics in Medicine - 2013](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1002/sim.5963).
