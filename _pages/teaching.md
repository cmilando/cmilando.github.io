# Methods

## B-spline functions

[![B-spline functions](/assets/images/Bspline_thumb.PNG)](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1E8ozpvn5O1euQtNcaiMLqa-QP4Q_PBpoAX7TgeKYCkU/edit?usp=sharing)

B-splines are an essential part of many computer science functions, but what are they and how do they work? I developed a spreadsheet to walk through the Cox-de Boor recursion implementation of cubic b-splines with one knot (click the image above).

## Conditional and Unconditional Poisson regression
[![Poisson](/assets/images/Poisson.png)](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1eNbHk5S-NEwsu49rO7XXXCVJnmLdLUQRxH3OQ-5HwUU/edit?usp=sharing) Recreating the similarity between the conditional and unconditional poisson models for case-crossover epidemiology. In google sheets (click the image above), Solver used to minimize the log-likelihood function. Sample R code and data adapted from: ["Conditional Poisson models: a flexible alternative to conditional logistic case cross-over analysis" by Ben Armstrong, Antonio Gasparrini, Aurelio Tobias. BMC Medical Research Methodology - 2014](https://bmcmedresmethodol.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/1471-2288-14-122).

## Distributed Lag Non-linear Modeling (DLNM)
[![DLNM](/assets/images/DLNM.png)](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1SP6PTXO6TtaVxoACTi5at0KpCNa9jmGhb6vR4PSiYmg/edit?usp=sharing) A fully working example of the steps of Distributed Lag Non-linear Modeling (click the image above), as described by Dr. Antonio Gasparrini in
["Modeling exposure–lag–response associations with distributed lag non-linear models" by Antonio Gasparrini. Statistics in Medicine - 2013](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1002/sim.5963).
