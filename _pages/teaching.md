This page lists teaching tools (in Excel, R, and Python), as well as pdfs of presentations I've given on topics relevant to environmental health, engineering and introductions to computer science.

## B-spline functions

B-splines are an essential part of many computer science functions, but what are they and how do they work? I developed a spreadsheet to walk through the Cox-de Boor recursion implementation of cubic b-splines with one knot (click the image above).

## Conditional and Unconditional Poisson regression
[![Poisson](/assets/images/Poisson.png)](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1eNbHk5S-NEwsu49rO7XXXCVJnmLdLUQRxH3OQ-5HwUU/edit?usp=sharing) Recreating the similarity between the conditional and unconditional poisson models for case-crossover epidemiology. In google sheets, Solver used to minimize the log-likelihood function. Sample R code and data adapted from:
["Conditional Poisson models: a flexible alternative to conditional logistic	case cross-over analysis" by Ben Armstrong, Antonio Gasparrini, Aurelio Tobias. BMC Medical Research Methodology - 2014](http://www.ag-myresearch.com/2014_armstrong_bmcmrm.html)
